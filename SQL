--SQL queries written for use in Google BigQuery


--1
Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From `covid-365903.covid.covid_deaths`
Where continent is not null 
Order by 1,2

--2
Select location, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From `covid-365903.covid.covid_deaths`
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
Group by location
Order by TotalDeathCount desc

--3
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From `covid-365903.covid.covid_deaths`
Group by Location, Population
Order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

--4
--Small more manageable size to export
Select Location, Population,date, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From `covid-365903.covid.covid_deaths`
where location = 'North America'
or location = 'South America'
or location = 'Asia'
or location = 'Europe'
or location = 'Africa'
or location = 'Oceania'
Group by Location, Population, date
Order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

--Extra
